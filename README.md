# WatchList
The app helps you to organize your future watching intentions.
You saw for example a cool trailer of a movie or someone recommended you a series but you have no time at the moment to watch it.
Just put the name of the content and the date of the watching and you are set.
# In the future updates
The ability of notifying you when the time is  set to watch the content will be available.
